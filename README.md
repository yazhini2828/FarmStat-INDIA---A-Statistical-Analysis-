# Agriculture analysis

The dataset contains details about the crop, harvested state and year, yield etc.
First, univariate analysis have been done to know more about a particular variable.

Then, we have compared the yield of crops using z score analysis.

After that we have used naive bayes classification algorith to classify whether the particular crop with particular production and cultivation cost will give profit or loss.

Then we have used central limit theorm to know wether the data is in normal distribution or not.

Also, we have used Maximum Liklihood Estimator to check the best distribution that fits the data the best.

We have also done some visualization using power BI to make the analysis even better.

Finally, conclusions and predictions.
